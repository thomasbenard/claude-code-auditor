# Chapter 10: Advanced Features

This chapter covers Claude Code's advanced capabilities: hooks for automation, worktrees for isolation, headless mode for CI/CD, IDE integrations, and more. For MCP (Model Context Protocol), see [Chapter 6](06-mcp.md).

## Hooks

Hooks are automated shell commands that execute at specific lifecycle events. They let you enforce standards, automate formatting, integrate with external tools, and customize Claude Code's behavior.

### Hook Events

| Event | When it fires | Matcher input | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SessionStart` | Session begins or resumes | `startup`, `resume`, `clear`, `compact` | Environment setup, notifications |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | Before Claude processes a prompt | (no matcher) | Input validation, logging |
| `PreToolUse` | Before a tool executes | Tool name | Block forbidden actions, validation |
| `PermissionRequest` | Permission dialog appears | Tool name | Auto-approve/deny based on rules |
| `PostToolUse` | After a tool succeeds | Tool name | Auto-format, lint, post-processing |
| `PostToolUseFailure` | After a tool fails | Tool name | Error logging, fallback actions |
| `Notification` | Claude needs attention | `permission_prompt`, `idle_prompt` | Desktop notifications |
| `SubagentStart` | Subagent spawns | Agent name | Tracking, logging |
| `SubagentStop` | Subagent finishes | Agent name | Tracking, logging |
| `Stop` | Claude finishes responding | (no matcher) | Post-response actions |
| `PreCompact` | Before context compaction | `manual`, `auto` | Save state before compaction |
| `ConfigChange` | Configuration file changes | Config type | React to config updates |

### Hook Configuration

Hooks are configured in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "prettier --write \"$FILE\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash .claude/hooks/validate-bash.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Notification": [
      {
        "matcher": "permission_prompt|idle_prompt",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "notify-send 'Claude Code needs attention'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Hook Input and Output

**Input**: Hooks receive JSON on stdin:

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "cwd": "/project",
  "hook_event_name": "PreToolUse",
  "tool_name": "Bash",
  "tool_input": {
    "command": "npm test"
  }
}
```

**Output and exit codes**:
- **Exit 0**: Allow the action. Stdout is added to Claude's context.
- **Exit 2**: Block the action. Stderr is shown as feedback to Claude.
- **Other exit codes**: Allow the action. Stderr is logged silently.

### Hook for Permission Decisions

Hooks can output JSON to make permission decisions:

```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "permissionDecision": "allow",
    "permissionDecisionReason": "NPM test commands are always allowed"
  }
}
```

Valid decisions: `allow`, `deny`, `ask`.

### Practical Hook Examples

**Auto-format after edits:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .claude/hooks/format-on-edit.sh
INPUT=$(cat)
FILE=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_input.file_path // empty')
if [ -n "$FILE" ] && [ -f "$FILE" ]; then
  prettier --write "$FILE" 2>/dev/null
fi
exit 0
```

**Block edits to protected files:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .claude/hooks/protect-files.sh
INPUT=$(cat)
FILE=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_input.file_path // empty')

PROTECTED_PATTERNS=(".env" ".git/" "node_modules/" "dist/")

for pattern in "${PROTECTED_PATTERNS[@]}"; do
  if [[ "$FILE" == *"$pattern"* ]]; then
    echo "Blocked: cannot modify protected path containing '$pattern'" >&2
    exit 2
  fi
done
exit 0
```

**Run linter after writes:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
INPUT=$(cat)
FILE=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_input.file_path // empty')

if [[ "$FILE" == *.ts ]] || [[ "$FILE" == *.tsx ]]; then
  eslint --fix "$FILE" 2>/dev/null
fi
exit 0
```

## Worktrees

Git worktrees allow you to work on multiple branches simultaneously without switching. Claude Code integrates worktrees for isolated, parallel development.

### What Are Worktrees?

A worktree is a separate working directory linked to the same Git repository. Each worktree has its own branch, staged changes, and working files, but shares the same Git history.

### Creating Worktrees

```bash
# Start Claude Code in a new worktree
claude --worktree

# With a custom name (also becomes the branch name)
claude --worktree feature-auth

# Manually create and enter a worktree
git worktree add .claude/worktrees/feature-auth -b feature-auth
cd .claude/worktrees/feature-auth
claude
```

### Within a Session

Use the `EnterWorktree` tool or ask Claude:

```
Work on this feature in an isolated worktree so it doesn't affect main.
```

### Worktree Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: A new directory is created under `.claude/worktrees/` with a fresh branch from HEAD
2. **Working**: Claude Code's working directory switches to the worktree
3. **Cleanup**:
   - If no changes were made: worktree is auto-removed on session exit
   - If changes exist: Claude prompts you to keep or remove the worktree

### When to Use Worktrees

- **Parallel experiments**: Try multiple approaches without conflicting
- **Feature isolation**: Develop a feature without affecting the main branch
- **Subagent isolation**: Configure subagents with `isolation: worktree` for safe parallel writes
- **Risk-free exploration**: Make experimental changes you might discard

### Worktree Cleanup

```bash
# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove a specific worktree
git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/feature-auth

# Prune stale worktree references
git worktree prune
```

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

For comprehensive coverage of MCP -- including architecture, configuration, authentication, popular servers, building custom servers, debugging, and best practices -- see [Chapter 6: MCP](06-mcp.md).

## Headless Mode

Claude Code can run without interactive input, making it suitable for scripts, CI/CD pipelines, and automation.

### Basic Headless Usage

```bash
# Single prompt, get response on stdout
claude -p "explain the main function in src/index.ts"

# With JSON output
claude -p "list all TODO comments" --output-format json

# With a specific permission mode
claude -p "run all tests and report results" --permission-mode bypassPermissions

# Pipe input
echo "fix the typo in README.md" | claude -p
```

### CI/CD Integration

**GitHub Actions example:**

```yaml
name: Code Review
on: pull_request

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install Claude Code
        run: npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
      - name: Review PR
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
        run: |
          claude -p "Review the changes in this PR. Run 'git diff origin/main'
          to see changes. Report any issues." --permission-mode bypassPermissions
```

### Scripting with Claude Code

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Generate a changelog from recent commits
CHANGELOG=$(claude -p "Read the git log for the last 10 commits and
generate a human-readable changelog grouped by type (features, fixes, etc.)" \
  --permission-mode plan)

echo "$CHANGELOG" > CHANGELOG.md
```

## IDE Integrations

### VS Code

The Claude Code VS Code extension provides a graphical interface:

**Key features:**
- Chat panel in the sidebar or as a tab
- Inline diff review for proposed changes
- @-mention files with line ranges (`@src/auth.ts#40-60`)
- Multiple conversations in tabs
- Plan mode with visual review

**Shortcuts:**
| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Esc` | Open in new tab |
| `Ctrl+N` | New conversation |
| `Alt+K` | Insert @-mention |
| `Ctrl+Esc` | Toggle focus |

### JetBrains IDEs

Available for IntelliJ, PyCharm, WebStorm, GoLand, RubyMine, and more via the JetBrains marketplace.

### Desktop App

Claude Code Desktop provides a native application interface for macOS and Windows.

## Browser Automation

Claude Code can interact with browsers via the Claude in Chrome extension and MCP:

- Navigate web pages
- Read page content (accessibility trees, screenshots)
- Fill forms and click elements
- Execute JavaScript in page context
- Record GIF demos
- Take screenshots for visual verification

### Preview System

For local development, Claude Code can preview your app:

1. Configure dev server in `.claude/launch.json`
2. Claude starts the server with `preview_start`
3. Takes screenshots and snapshots to verify changes
4. Inspects DOM elements for styling verification

## Extended Thinking

Extended thinking gives Claude an internal "scratchpad" for complex reasoning:

- Toggle with `Alt+T`
- Consumes additional tokens (viewable with `Ctrl+O` for verbose mode)
- Improves quality on complex debugging, architecture, and multi-step reasoning
- Not needed for simple tasks

Use extended thinking when:
- Debugging subtle issues with multiple possible causes
- Making architectural decisions
- Working through complex logic or algorithms
- Planning multi-step refactors

Skip it when:
- Making simple edits
- Running commands
- Quick file lookups
